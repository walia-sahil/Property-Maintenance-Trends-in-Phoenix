# Property Maintenance Trends in Phoenix 🏘️

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **property maintenance complaints in Phoenix** to uncover neighborhood-level insights, evaluate complaint resolution efficiency, and identify resource allocation opportunities.  
The goal is to understand how complaint status, inspections, and enforcement actions (tickets/notices) impact resolution timelines, and to suggest ways to improve city services.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Phoenix residents regularly report property maintenance issues such as **overgrown grass, weeds, parking violations, and housing concerns**.  
This project explores:
- Which neighborhoods report the most complaints
- How inspection frequency impacts resolution
- Differences between informal vs formal enforcement actions
- Best vs worst performing council districts

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Districts 5 & 8** had the highest number of complaints — likely linked to population density or socio-economic factors.  
- **Districts 2 & 6** had the lowest complaint counts and resolutions.  
- **Cases with tickets or formal notices** required more inspections to resolve, showing higher complexity.  
- **Recurring issues** like overgrown vegetation and parking violations highlight areas for targeted city efforts.  
- Strong link observed: **more inspections = higher chance of unresolved or complex cases**.

## 🛠️ Methods
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensured unique case IDs, corrected addresses, filled missing values.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Case counts, inspection counts, status distribution, council district comparisons.  
- **Visualization**: Highlighted high vs low performing neighborhoods.  
- **Interpretation**: Identified systemic trends and outliers.
